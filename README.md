# Soccer Game
### This website is a new game (playing soccer with dice) and I have used HTML5, CSS3, ES6 and Bootstrap5 in this project.
### The whole Idea of this game is new and uniqe and it is invented by me.

# How to play this game :
### At first you have to open the createGame.html file to customize your own team (name of your players, name of your team/leauge, color of your players, and image of your team). You have to compelete all the forms (images are optional).
##### NOTE! you can not go to the main soccer page unless you complete the forms.
### Once you completed the form, click submit and you will be redirected to the soccer.html which is the main page.
