# Soccer Game
### This website is a new game (playing soccer with dice) and I have used HTML5, CSS3, ES6 and Bootstrap5 in this project.
### The whole Idea of this game is new and uniqe and it is invented by me.

# How to play this game :
### At first you have to open the createGame.html file to customize your own team (name of your players, name of your team/leauge, color of your players, and image of your team). You have to complete all the forms (images are optional).

- NOTE! (you can not go to the main page unless you complete the form)
### Once you completed the form, click submit and you will be redirected to the soccer.html which is the main page.

### If you want to move a player, at first click on that player and then press the arrow buttons on keyboard (if you want to use your numericPad make sure turn on the numlk). If you want to move the ball, you shoud press the kyes: (q, w, e, a, d, z, x, c) to move the ball to different directions.

### If a player and the ball are in a same square, you can press "l". it makes ball and player stick together so move together.

### On the top right corner of the field ther is a black triangle shaped button. if you click on that, a Modal will open that shows informtaion about both teams and you can roll dice there. And if you click "finish game" the game will be finished and all the team's information will be deleted and you will be redirected to the createGame page to create the game. Again.

- NOTE! (You can change number of dices but I dont recommend. the game works with just two).
### The left dice is for normall player and ball movement (up, down, left, right).
### The right dice is for speciall moves (1:dribble,  2:giving the ball away , 3:foul,  4:cross passing,  5:zigzag moves,  6: six moves + left side dice moves)

### If a player has done many fouls, you can send off the player by clicking on it and press backspace, the player disappears.

### If you bring your cursor on the players (hover them), their name will appear.
